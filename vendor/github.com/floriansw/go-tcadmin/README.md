# go-tcadmin

A simple, purpose-built client library to interact with the TCAdmin control panel.
It is built and tested for the control panel of Qonzer (https://qonzer.com) with the game Hell Let Loose.
Other games or GSPs using TCAdmin might be supported as well, but might require some customization.
Especially when it comes to the `SetServerInfo` method.

## Usage

See `tools/example/cmd.go` for an example.
